Pre-requisites:

You will need to be added to a specific allow list which will allow you to impersonate
the service account `payment-reseller-test-serv-734@eng-diagram-369411.iam.gserviceaccount.com`

Verify running below command:
gcloud projects list --impersonate-service-account='payment-reseller-test-serv-734@eng-diagram-369411.iam.gserviceaccount.com'
If it succeeds, you are all set.


Steps:

- Save your google cloud credentials to a local file to run the code.
  -  Run the command `gcloud auth application-default login`. This should
     trigger an oauth screen asking permissions run google cloud cli. Login with
     the allow listed account and give permissions.

     Credentials will be saved to a local file with directory path
     `~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json`


  -  You are all setup, you can execute specific code
     Verify with running an impersonate code which should print the access token
