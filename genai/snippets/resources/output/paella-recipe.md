Here's an illustrated recipe for a delicious paella!

**Step 1: Sauté Aromatics and Meat**

Heat olive oil in a large paella pan or wide, shallow pan over medium heat. Sauté chopped onions and garlic until fragrant. Add your chosen protein (chicken pieces, rabbit, or seafood like shrimp and mussels) and cook until lightly browned. Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of saffron threads.

**Step 2: Add Vegetables and Rice**

Stir in diced bell peppers, tomatoes, and any other desired vegetables (like green beans or peas) and cook for a few minutes until slightly softened. Then, add short-grain paella rice (Bomba or Calasparra are ideal) and stir to coat the grains with the oil and juices.

**Step 3: Pour in Broth and Simmer**

Pour in hot chicken or vegetable broth (or seafood stock if making seafood paella). Distribute the ingredients evenly across the pan, but **do not stir the rice** after this point. Bring to a gentle simmer.

**Step 4: Cook Until Liquid Absorbed**

Reduce the heat to low and continue to simmer, uncovered, for about 15-20 minutes, or until most of the liquid has been absorbed and the rice is tender. If using shellfish like mussels or clams, add them during the last 5-10 minutes of cooking so they steam open.
